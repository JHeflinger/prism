design philosophy:
    - blender but make it i3
    - why?
        - because I hate using trackpad

ui todos:
    - focused panel
    - tabbed panels
    - closeable panels
    - move panels with keybinds
    - accomodate screen resize

ideas:
    - psuedo-frameless:
        - after getting raytracing working:
        - trace a random # of rays
            - if a frame takes greater than a certain time to render, reduce the random # next frame
            - if a frame takes less, do the opposite
                - just make sure you do this scaled in accordance to how much faster/slower it is

after tutorial hell:
    - condense as much as possible
    - refactor to have raylib-type functionality
